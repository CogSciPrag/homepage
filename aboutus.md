The unifying topic of our group is understanding pragmatic language interpretation and production. This means that we are looking at natural language *in context* which may combine the visual world, common knowledge etc, and is *used by agents*, human or artificial, to achieve various goals. Our research also involves topics in psycholinguistics and cognitive modeling. Our projects also usuallly involve some Bayesian component.

We highly value interdisciplinary perspectives, open science and reproducibility in our work. Some tools and resources we use in out projects that were developed by the lab and affiliated collaborators are linked below. 

## Current projects

## Software & Resources

### Web-based experiments 
The framework[_magpie](https://magpie-ea.github.io/magpie-docs/) based on `vue.js` for running web-based experiments with participants.

### Webbooks
* A webbook on [probabilistic pragmatics](http://www.problang.org/)
* A webbook on [Bayesian data analysis with R](https://michael-franke.github.io/intro-data-analysis/index.html).
* A webbook on [neural language generation with LMs](https://michael-franke.github.io/npNLG/000-intro.html) with PyTorch.

### Datasets
Annotated 3Dshapes dataset [A3DS](https://github.com/polina-tsvilodub/3dshapes-language) (image-text dataset comprising images of geometric shapes with different caption annotations).

### Packages
Package [faintr](https://michael-franke.github.io/faintr/index.html) for working with categorical variables in regression models in R.
