# Leader

## [Michael Franke](https://michael-franke.github.io/heimseite/)
![](/_assets/images/MF.png)
Michael is a professor at the Department of Linguistics at the University of Tübingen. He is interested broadly in cognitive and evolutionary modeling and applications thereof to language use, reasoning, decision making and other features of higher-order cognition. The focus of his work is on experimental pragmatics, supplemented with probabilistic modeling. He is also interested in foundational questions concerning the relation between empirical data, abstract theory and explicit mathematical modeling.
Please contact the <a href="mailto:sekretariat.pragmatik@semsprach.uni-tuebingen.de">secretary's office</a> for all organizational matters.

# Postdocs
## [Juliane Schwab](https://julianeschwab.github.io)
I am a post-doctoral researcher at the Department of Linguistics at the University of Tübingen. 
In my research, I aim for an interdisciplinary perspective, combining methods and insights from theoretical linguistics, psycho- and neurolinguistics, and Bayesian statistical modelling to elucidate how natural language is used and processed, and to characterize language from a dynamic interactive perspective between speaker(s), listener(s) and context in a wide sense.
I am broadly interested in the semantics/pragmatics interface, probabilistic pragmatic modelling, and cognitive mechanisms involved in language processing. 

## [Fausto Carcassi](https://thelogicalgrammar.github.io/)
I am a Sardinian researcher at the University of Tübingen, where I am doing a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Individual Fellowship with Michael Franke. In this project, I apply various methods, both computational and experimental, to further our understanding of plausible deniability. 

# Graduate Students
## Polina Tsvilodub
I am a first-year PhD student. In my projects I work towards understanding how neural language models inclduing LLMs generate pragmatic natural language and which aspects contribute to this capacity. My approach is influenced by my training in Cognitive Science and combines methods from psycholnguistics as well as state-of-the-art NLP and AI. Currently I look at models for pragmatic grounded natural language generation and open-ended question answering.
