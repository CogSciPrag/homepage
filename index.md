## Welcome to the CogSciPrag homepage!

We are the Cognitive Science of Pragmatics group, **CogSciPrag**, at the University of TÃ¼bingen. Our goal is to broadly understand how natural language is interpreted and produced, and how these processes are guided by different aspects like context, reasoning mechanisms and the agents' nature. We approach these questions from an interdisciplinary perspective of Cognitive Science. Our methods and interests include Bayesian modeling, web-based experiments with human participants, and experiments with neural network agents.
